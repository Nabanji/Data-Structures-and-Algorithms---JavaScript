// Tree - A DS tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure. It represents a collection of elements (data) called nodes, connected by edges (links) forming a tree-like structure.

// Leaf Node - A node that does not have any children

// Full Tree - A tree where each node either has no children (leaf node) or exactly two children

// Perfect Tree - Full + Balance
//              - All the leaf nodes are at the same depth (distance from the root). This means the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level 

// Complete tree - Almost Full Levels -> All levels except possibly the last one are completely filled with nodes.
                    Left Leaning Last Level -> The last level is filled with nodes from the left side as much as possible. There might be empty spaces on the right



Binary Search Tree -> A BST is a special kind of binary tree used to organize data in a sorted way. It works like a filing cabinet where you can efficiently search, add or remove items.... NOTE ->Go left if your value is smaller than the current branch. Go right if your value is bigger
