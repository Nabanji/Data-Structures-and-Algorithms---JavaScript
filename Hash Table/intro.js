// Data structure used to store key-value pairs
// Hash function - acts like a translator, taking an input of any size (key) and converting it into a fixed-size value (hash code) that can be used as an index within the hash table's internal array. This process of mapping arbitrary-sized keys to fixed-length indices is called hashing.
